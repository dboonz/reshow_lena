In the last version of Scipy the standard image for image processing was removed. This tiny repository enables you to re-use it. I simply copied the original function from the scipy archive.

Installing:

just clone the repo and type

    python setup.py develop

And you're ready to go.

To use it afterwards, replace all

    from scipy.misc import lena

with
  
    from reshow_lena import lena

And you should be ready to go.
